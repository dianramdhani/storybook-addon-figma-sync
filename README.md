A Storybook addon designed to sync Figma design frames directly into Storybook stories. It enables developers to overlay mockups on top of live components with adjustable opacity, auto-resize the Storybook preview iframe to match Figma dimensions, and perform pixel-level visual regression diffing directly in the browser to ensure absolute design fidelity.

---

## Key Features

- **Figma Design Integration**: Input any Figma Frame URL in the Storybook toolbar to download and display design mockups.
- **Figma Panel & Component Discovery**: Open the **Figma** bottom panel to inspect reusable components used by the selected layout. The drawer groups component-set variants, shows usage counts, and links resolvable components back to Figma.
- **On-Demand Component Previews**: Preview a component as a PNG only when requested. Previews are cached for the current story, can be shown or hidden, and support scroll-to-zoom and drag-to-pan.
- **Interactive Visual Overlay**: Render the Figma mockup directly over your live component with customizable opacity (0% to 100%) and a toggle switch.
- **Automated Component Sizing**: Storybook's preview iframe automatically resizes to the exact dimensions of the Figma design frame, ensuring realistic component alignment.
- **Pixel-Matching Similarity Analysis**: Captures a high-fidelity DOM screenshot of the rendered component using `html-to-image` and compares it pixel-by-pixel with the Figma design using `pixelmatch`.
- **REST API for Automation**: Trigger visual audits programmatically via a dev server endpoint, featuring automatic story navigation, render delay buffers, and solid white background compositing for consistent pixelmatch results.
- **Advanced Analysis Modal**: Switch between three comparison views in the visual audit panel:
  - **Side-by-Side**: Compare the Figma design and live component screenshot side by side.
  - **Overlay (Interactive)**: A draggable and zoomable canvas layer where the Figma mockup is overlaid on the component screenshot.
  - **Diff Only**: A visual diff highlighting the pixel mismatch errors in red.
- **Single JSON Registry (`registry.json`)**: Persists all sync metadata—such as Story ID, Figma URLs, asset paths, similarity scores, overlay visibility, and opacity percentages—in a single database file, isolating settings per story.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Downloaded Figma design images are stored locally under `.storybook/.storybook-addon-figma-sync/` for fast loading and reduced API consumption.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React 19**: Drives the Storybook addon manager UI, interactive comparison canvas, and modal interfaces.
- **Storybook 8+**: Integrates with the modern Storybook core channels, globals, parameters, and component registry.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across all frontend and backend middleware.
- **Vite & Webpack**: Exposes Node.js dev server middlewares to serve and cache Figma assets.
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Integrated for styling storybook components and styling tests.
- **Pixelmatch**: A pixel-level image comparison library written in JavaScript.
- **pngjs**: Enables direct PNG decoding, diff output, and encoding inside the Node.js server.
- **html-to-image**: Converts DOM nodes to high-resolution PNG data URLs on the client.
- **tsup**: Bundler configured to output targeted ESM modules for the manager, preview, and Node.js preset.
- **Vitest**: Used as the test runner for unit tests.

## Project Architecture

The addon is structured into three main layers: **Manager UI** (the toolbar and Figma panel), **Preview iframe** (overlay and screenshot capture), and **Node server preset** (handles Figma API interaction and image comparisons).

### Data Flow & Component Interaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Figma account and a **Figma Personal Access Token (PAT)**. You can generate one in Figma by going to `Settings > Account > Personal access tokens`.

### Installation

Install the package as a development dependency using your package manager:

```bash
yarn add -D storybook-addon-figma-sync
# or
npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-figma-sync
# or
pnpm add -D storybook-addon-figma-sync
```

### Configuration

#### 1. Register the Addon

Add the addon to your `.storybook/main.ts` file:

```typescript
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-docs',
    {
      name: 'storybook-addon-figma-sync',
      options: {
        envLocation: '../.env', // Path to your environment file containing FIGMA_TOKEN
      },
    },
  ],
  // Map local cache directory to static URL in Storybook
  staticDirs: [{ from: './.storybook-addon-figma-sync', to: '/figma-sync-assets' }],
  framework: '@storybook/react-vite',
};

export default config;
```

#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```bash
FIGMA_TOKEN=your_figma_personal_access_token_here
```

#### 3. Update Git Ignore

Add the local cache folder to your `.gitignore` to prevent committing cached Figma designs and screenshot differences:

```bash
.storybook/.storybook-addon-figma-sync/
```

## Component Discovery Workflow

After saving a valid Figma frame URL for a story:

1. Open Storybook's **Figma** bottom panel.
2. Select **Components** beside **Open in Figma**. The first open inspects the layout and lists the Figma components used by its instances.
3. Use **Search components** to filter by component name or variant. Use **Refresh** only when the Figma layout has changed and you need to fetch the list again.
4. Select **Show preview** to request a PNG preview from Figma. It is cached for the current story; use the mouse wheel to zoom and drag to pan. Select **Hide preview** to collapse it.
5. Select **Open in Figma** to navigate to the resolved source component.

Some component instances cannot be resolved to a source node by Figma. Those rows show `-` in the **Action** column and cannot be previewed or opened from the addon.

---

## REST API for Automated Visual Audits

The addon exposes a built-in REST API endpoint on the Storybook dev server for programmatic triggers (e.g., for CI pipelines, external/agentic scripts, or AI slicing tools).

### Endpoint

```http
GET http://localhost:6006/api/figma-sync/screenshot?storyId=<STORY_ID>
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "figmaSrc": "/figma-sync-assets/figma-<storyId>.png",
  "screenshotSrc": "/figma-sync-assets/ss-<storyId>.png",
  "diffSrc": "/figma-sync-assets/diff-<storyId>.png",
  "similarity": 94.25
}
```

### Key Behaviors

1. **Auto-Navigation**: The dev server middleware automatically navigates the active story in the Storybook preview iframe to match the requested `storyId`, utilizing a `1200ms` delay buffer to let the render tree settle before capturing the screenshot.
2. **Transparency Compositing**: To resolve false mismatches from alpha channel transparency (e.g., empty backgrounds, transparent PNGs), both the Figma mockup and the captured screenshot are composited onto a solid white background prior to pixelmatch comparison.
3. **Ignoring Elements**: Specific HTML elements can be excluded from screenshots by applying the `data-figma-sync-ignore="true"` attribute to them.

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

To run the Storybook project locally and develop the addon:

```bash
yarn start
```

This runs the `tsup` compiler in watch mode (rebuilding code in real-time) and launches the Storybook developer server concurrently.

### Build and Package

To build the project for production distribution:

```bash
yarn build
```

This uses `tsup` to bundle all inputs. It splits files according to their execution targets:

- `dist/manager.js` (Browser Manager UI)
- `dist/preview.js` & `dist/preview.d.ts` (Browser Preview Iframe)
- `dist/preset.js` (Node.js Dev Server Middlewares)

### Ejecting TypeScript

If you wish to convert this template to standard JavaScript, you can run:

```bash
yarn eject-ts
```

> [!WARNING]
> This is a destructive, irreversible process. We recommend running this before you write any custom addon code.

## Coding Standards

This project enforces strict coding quality gates:

- **Linting**: Rules configured using [ESLint](./eslint.config.js). Run checks using `yarn lint` or apply fixes with `yarn lint:fix`.
- **Formatting**: Styles managed using [Prettier](./.prettierrc). Run formatting using `yarn format`.
- **Type Safety**: Managed by TypeScript with strict checks. Checked automatically during builds.
- **Git Hooks**: Integrated with [Husky](./.husky) and [lint-staged](./package.json) to format and lint changes automatically on git commit.
- **Commit Conventions**: Conventional commits are enforced using `@commitlint/cli` and `commitlint.config.js`.

---

## Testing

Backend helpers, asset file structures, and pixel comparisons are tested using **Vitest**.

To run unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Tests cover:

- base64 PNG data URL decoding.
- Dev-server disk operations (screenshot file writes and deletions).
- Image similarity percentage calculations.
- Error handling (e.g. throwing error outputs when Figma design dimensions mismatch Storybook rendering).
